# Bullet Note

A couple of years ago, I decided to make the transition from a full-time technical role in software development to that of a manager.  For me, thankfully the transition was pretty easy, however as the breadth of what  I managed grew and grew, I found that I was very ill equipped in terms of basic discipline around note taking and task tracking.  I've tried numerous ways to stay on top of things:

- Todo lists (e.g. Todoist)
- Trello
- Asana
- Evernote
- Hybrids of all of the above.

The most effective one I found was the "Bullet Journal", an analog system that has become quite popular over the past few years.  However, for me it presented a lot of difficulty, as I had to transition between analog and digital and either things got lost in the shuffle, or it was simply a big time sink.

This project is my attempt at building a combined Note-Taking and Task Tracking app, optimized for my own personal workflow.  Let's see how it goes!
